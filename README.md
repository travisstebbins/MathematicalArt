A Java program that can generate neat images based on different factors

The main class contains a variety of functions that can be used to generate 
images based on different criteria. Read the comments in the main class to 
learn about what kind of image each function generates. You can also change 
the rMax, gMax, and bMax values to change the colors that the program can 
generate.

See examples of the kinds of images that can be generated in the generated_images 
folder.
